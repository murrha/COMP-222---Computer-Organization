Programming Assignment 1 Performance Assessment

Objective:

To write a C program (not C++) that calculates the average CPI, total processing time (T), and MIPS of a sequence of instructions, given the number of instruction classes, the CPI and total count of each instruction type, and the clock rate (frequency) of the machine.

Refer to zyBooks Chapter 1 and/or the PowerPoint presentation in my Canvas Module for the correct formulas to implement.

The following is what the program would look like if it were run interactively. Your program will read values without using prompts.

Inputs:

• Clock rate of machine (MHz) • Number of instruction classes (types) • CPI of each type of instruction • Total instruction count for each type of instruction

Specification:

The program calculates the output based on choosing from a menu of choices, where each choice calls the appropriate procedure, where the choices are:
